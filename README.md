# Currency Converter with Glassmorphism UI and Video Background

## Overview

This project is a sleek, modern Currency Converter web application featuring a stylish **glassmorphism** design and a full-page looping **video background** to create an engaging and immersive user experience. The app allows users to convert currencies seamlessly with an intuitive UI designed for clarity and ease of use.

## Features

- **Glassmorphism UI:**  
  Uses translucent backgrounds, blur effects, and subtle shadows to create a modern and visually appealing interface.

- **Full-Screen Video Background:**  
  Enhances user experience with a smooth, muted, looping video that adds dynamic and professional aesthetics without distracting from the content.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Fully responsive layout that works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **User-Friendly Currency Selection:**  
  Buttons with clear country codes and a down-arrow icon indicate interactive dropdowns for selecting currencies (JavaScript dropdown logic can be added as needed).

- **Swap Functionality:**  
  Easily swap base and target currencies with an animated button.

- **Accessibility Considerations:**  
  Inputs and buttons have appropriate labels for better screen reader support.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**  
  Semantic markup and modern CSS features including variables, flexbox/grid layouts, and backdrop-filter for blur effects.

- **Google Fonts:**  
  Utilizes the 'Outfit' font for clean and modern typography.

- **Video Integration:**  
  Uses a high-quality, royalty-free video from Pixabay as the background.

## Why This Project Stands Out

This project combines cutting-edge design trends with practical functionality. The glassmorphism style paired with a vibrant video background creates a polished and modern look that is both user-friendly and visually impressive. Its simplicity, responsiveness, and clean code make it an excellent example of UI/UX design excellence in hackathons.
